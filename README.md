# Codechef
Extract the problems from codechef


Downloads all the problems of a given contest on codechef, and saves them in respective files.

The name of the contest has to be passed as CLA
e.g: If the contest's link is https://www.codechef.com/LTIME51 , "LTIME51" has to be passed as CLA

New Directory under the name of the contest will be created

And within that directory, files corresponfing to each problem will be created.

The files will also be opened in a text editor.
The program will ask for the name of your favourite text editor (e.g. gedit). And on giving the favorite text editor, the problems will be opened using that text editor.
